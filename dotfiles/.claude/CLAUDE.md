# Claude Instructions

- Do not answer with lies or guesses. Always investigate thoroughly and provide responses with clear evidence and reasoning.
- When asked to create documentation, create it in markdown format under the `.claude/tmp` directory in the current directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist).
- When you need to ask for user's decision or judgment, use the AskUserQuestion tool.
